>[!tip] OpCodes and Registers of Note for this section.
>So, we'll highlight some OpCodes and Registers here. If you want to read more about them, check out the VCS.h documentation on 8BitWorkshop or this brief webpage: https://problemkaputt.de/2k6specs.htm
>
>First, we will have Horizontal Motion
>`HMCLR` - All registers related to movement are cleared. These are the ones with the `HMXXX` moniker.
>`HMM0` - Horizontal Motion Missile 1
>`HMM1` - Horizontal Motion Missile 2
>`HMP0` - Horizontal Motion Player 1
>`HMP1` - Horizontal Motion Player 2 
>`HMBL` - Horizontal Motion for the Ball
>`HMOVE` - Apply Horizontal Motion
>
>Next, we get into some super important registers for resetting players. You'll need these.
>`RESP0` - Reset Position Player 1
>`RESP1` - Reset Position Player 2
>`RESM0` - Reset Position Missile 1
>`RESM1` - Reset Position Missile 2
>`RESBL` - Reset Position of the Ball
>
>Finally, let's set up our registers for player graphics.
>`GRP0` - Graphics Register Player 0
>`GRP1` - Graphics Register Player 1
>`ENAM0` - Graphics Enable Missle 0
>`ENAM1` -  Graphics Enable Missle 1
>`ENABL` - Graphics Enable Ball
#  Let's talk about Sprites
So, we're going to start getting ourselves into creating little graphics for our players. From here, we'll be making it move, adding some enemies, adding an ability to shoot bullets, and more. 

We're going to begin by doing this in the most inefficient way possible and we'll start layering things on so we can figure out everything from Sprites to movement to balls to enemy movement.

So now we got a sprite on screen, let's think about moving it! How do...we do that?

# Two's Compliment
Two's complement and the way the 2600 affords for its expression is how you represent the numbers  0 to 255 as -128 to +127. We need negative numbers for things like movement schema and for other reasons we'll get to as time allows. 

Now, the numbers 0->127 are represented the same way in binary / hex. So, if you only need to deal with positive numbers then there is not much of a space to get confused. Where problems begin is with negative numbers. This is weird!!! I know I say this a lot in this class. 

In the 2600, the far left or upper bit of the number is the sign and so we have 0xxxxxxx for a positive number and 1xxxxxxx as a negative number. Now, it isn't that easy!!!

A normal person might think that -1 would simply be represented as 10000001. However, this is not correct because we're not in normal spaces. Think of it like this,  there would be two zero values (+0 and -0). 

So what the 2600 wants Instead is when we convert a number into its negative, you invert the bits and add 1, so -1 becomes 11111111, which is 255 normally. 

This scheme is very clever as it does not require any extra hardware to cope with negative numbers, but can be a pain from a programming perspective.
