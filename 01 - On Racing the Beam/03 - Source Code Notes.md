Periodically, we will be using the source code of specific games as notes for the week. These are suggested as a source code to read because they have sections of code that afford us the ability to see something in action that we should be using. 

The games we'll be referring to should be well known to everyone entering the class and if they aren't known to the student, we'll have ample opportunity to play in class. 

Those games are going to be varied but we will start with: 
* Pong
* Combat
Afterward, we'll start getting a bit more complicated and go for games like: 
* Adventure
* Pac Man (Original and the Re-release)
* Yars Revenge
* Pitfall
* Halo 2600

Where possible, i will be offering other sources as they have been decompiled and are available elsewhere. 

I will pull source code from: 

1. Atari Age:

2. Github:

And others places. I'll update these sources as I find more. 

Also pulled some resources of dumping and decompiling other games:
