This is a course devoted to making the development of games on the Atari 2600 into a semester's worth of content. For the first 12 weeks, we will:

* go through source code and annotate it, 
* read [Racing the Beam](https://www.amazon.com/Racing-Beam-Computer-Platform-Studies/dp/0262539764/)
* develop a prototype and coding assignments
* spend the last five weeks alone or in a group making your own game

By the end of class, if you are happy with your game, I will pay for you to: 
* Print your game to cartridge (If I can get the equipment, i'll do this for you but I need to practice soldering a bit more)
* Print an instruction manual
* Make a game box (i'll provide some links and what materials and can help)

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Instance. If you want to view it all, please download the repo and open it in Obsidian. 
## IDEs, Useful Webpages, and Other Tutorials
I am one person who himself is still learning the finer points of Assembly 6502. I'm also teaching in a classroom in a college and as such, I have to make sure that certain bureaucratic requirements are met. In recognition of that, i'm going to include a variety of resources.
### Development Environments, Emulators, and IDEs
I don't really care what you use to write your games. I'm sort of forcing the class demonstrations on: https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.11.0/?platform=vcs&file=examples%2Fhello.a but you could write in Sublime, Notepad++, or whatever works for you! 

If you love visual studio: 
Syntax highlight package for Visual Studio Code: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chunkypixel.atari-dev-studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chunkypixel.atari-dev-studio)
- Syntax highlight package for Notepad++: [https://github.com/tragicmuffin/6502-npp-syntax](https://github.com/tragicmuffin/6502-npp-syntax)
- Syntax highlight package for Atom: [https://atom.io/packages/language-65asm](https://atom.io/packages/language-65asm)
- Syntax highlight file for Vim: [https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1314](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1314)
- Syntax highlight package for Emacs: [http://www.tomseddon.plus.com/beeb/6502-mode.html](http://www.tomseddon.plus.com/beeb/6502-mode.html)
#### Emulators, 
Primarily we will be using 2 emulators: 
* [Javatari](https://javatari.org/)
* [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/)

There are others out there but we'll stick with these two.

...And so many more.

This course will first be run in the Spring of 2025 and if successful, will be pitched as a course called, "Vintage Game Development" where it will be able to be split among all the 6502 systems or later, given that Vintage is probably up to around the 360 at this point.

Now that i've made you feel old, enjoy!
