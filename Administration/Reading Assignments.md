In this class, we are reading Racing the Beam and we have another textbook that is more reference than anything else called, Making Games for the Atari 2600 by Steven Hugg

An example response is this. I just wrote it and it is very stream of consciousness: 

	I grew up in a home that mostly leaned in to video games. It was the 80s though, so my exposure to games was first a Magnavox pong machine we had for a tiny black and white television. We played Pong for hours, days, all the time. It is a weird thing to be able to do that at home. We had an arcade at the mall but we weren’t allowed to go because it the was early 80s and arcades were places of ill reupute at that point.
	
	In reading this, I’ve been astounded by just how much work went into this machine. Beginning with the pinball industry and building on this was super interesting. I’ve seen the Spacewar machine at the Strong and I’ve played it a few times over the years in Arcades. It’s also fascinating to see just how much of an impact what Atari did had on games as a whole.
	
	One aspect of this console is that we see it now as primitive, as terrible, and yet in reading it, the idea that 128 bytes of RAM and 2k of ROM, later expanded to 4k is interesting when the Fairchild Channel F or Magnavox Odyssey are less than half the power of this behemoth. I’m also interested in the development of the RIOT chip and wonder just how much finagling happens with chipsets like they did with the 8080/6502/6507.
	
	I also love that I can buy a 6502 on Amazon for about $10-15 dollars or 6507 chips for even less. It is an enduring legacy for a chip to be used constantly for decades when the 486 infrastructure is harder to find. I am anxious to dig into this more.
	
	With regard to Combat, I have long been curious about the relationship between War and Video Games. We owe a lot of gaming to the machinery of war. To see this laid bare in Combat being the archetype for all other games on the system is certainly fascinating. More than that though, there’s some interesting consequences of bringing games home. On a single screen, you have the possibility of 2 people playing against each other in a symmetrical space, this was simple with pong or tennis for 2. However, it was more difficult at the time since the basis of a lot of arcade games was pinball games.
	
	Score attack is a constant feature of pinball and it wasn’t a surprise to see it in early video games. To see Combat become a prototype for what the Atari could do while simultaneously providing a canvas for what video games could be is fascinating.
