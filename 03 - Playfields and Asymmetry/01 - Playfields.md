I have gone through most of the reading assignments. We are starting coding this week, let's take an inventory of coding capacity in class and who might be more helpful. lkjhl
# <a id='assignment'></a>Assignment
This week, we're doing Source Code reading. This will probably be insanely difficult at first but I just want you to try your best. As we move forward, it will get easier as you'll be exposed to more stuff. 

The assignment is simple, I want the labels that check for missile collision with walls and the playfield and I want you to tell me how they work, what the logic is, and why. 
# <a id = "getstart"></a>Getting Started and Admin

The Atari 2600 has a chip that processes game logic and a Television Interface Adapter that sends that logic to the television screen. It literally paints the screen in real time as the processor goes through the logic. This is why we tie everything to our frame as we count the various scanlines. 

There are a variety of things we need to keep track of here. First, let's think about this: 

The background dictates the color of certain things. For example. Consider how colors in the 2600 work. We know that it can display a total of 128 colors and they can be displayed at the same time but below each other or in each individual scanline. 

This allows for our rainbow to appear though we were not going with all 128! Next, each scanline can only have 4 colors displayed at any given time. 

Finally, it is important to remember that some stuff shares colors. So, these share colors: 
* Playfield and Ball 
* Player0 and missile0 
* Player1 and missile1 

And to that end, we have 7 distinct game elements. Those elements are: 
1. Background 
2. Playfield 
3. Player 1 
4. Player 2 
5. Missile 1 
6. Missile 2 
7. Ball

So let's think about this image again:

We messed with this a little because of last week where we literally set up our frame and started making 3 scanlines and made a gentle rainbow. This is all background and so we will be moving from background to playfield in this lesson. 
# <a id="background"></a>Background
The background dictates the color of certain things. For example. Consider how colors in the 2600 work. We know that it can display a total of 128 colors and they can be displayed at the same time but below each other or in each individual scanline. 

This allows for our rainbow to appear though we were not going with all 128! Next, each scanline can only have 4 colors displayed at any given time. 

Finally, it is important to remember that some stuff shares colors. So: 
* Playfield and Ball 
* Player0 and missile0 
* Player1 and missile1 

This leaves us with 7 distinct game elements. Those elements are: 
1. Background 
2. Playfield 
3. Player 1 
4. Player 2 
5. Missile 1 
6. Missile 2 
7. Ball

While this doesn't seem like a lot, we got to keep all of this in mind while we work on our games. For example, while the playfield and ball have the same color, we need to be mindful of player0 and player1's color difference, especially as it relates to both the background and playfield. Should these things match, you may have some issues! 

First, let's mess a bit with some background colors. Let's go ahead and set up our basic shell.

```asm6502
	processor 6502
	include "vcs.h"
    include "macro.h"
    include "xmacro.h"
        
	seg	main
	org 	$F000
    
START: CLEAN_START

	org $FFFC
	.word START
	.word START
```

# <a id='playfield'></a>Playfield

We're going to take a piece of a tutorial from a youtuber named 8blit and work on it a bit. 

```asm6502
	processor 6502		; We need to call into being the 6502 on our IDE.
	include	 "vcs.h"
    include "macro.h"

; For this task, we're going to actually use some memory to mess around with the TIA PF0, PF1, PF2, and CTLRPF Registers. Along the way, we'll explore the issues of overscanning and safe areas to draw in the safe visual area of the screen with the the recommended number of VBLANK's

We can also try and do some stuff.

```asm6502
	PROCESSOR 6502
	INCLUDE "vcs.h"

	ORG $F000
START:
	SEI
	CLD
	LDX #$FF
	TXS
	LDA #$00
CLEAR:
	STA 0,X
	DEX
	BNE CLEAR

SHOW_FRAME:
	LDA #$88
	STA COLUBK

	STA WSYNC
	LDA #2
	STA VSYNC
	STA WSYNC
	STA WSYNC
	STA WSYNC
	LDA #0
	STA VSYNC

	LDX #36
TOP:
	STA WSYNC
	DEX
	BNE TOP

	LDA #2

	LDX #30
BOTTOM:
	STA WSYNC
	DEX
	BNE BOTTOM

	JMP SHOW_FRAME

	ORG $FFFC
	.word START
	.word START

```

and we can augment this a bit. 

```asm6502
	PROCESSOR 6502
	INCLUDE "vcs.h"

	ORG $F000

	SEI
	CLD
