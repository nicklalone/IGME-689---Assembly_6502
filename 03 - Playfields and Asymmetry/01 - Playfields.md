I have gone through most of the reading assignments. We are starting coding this week, let's take an inventory of coding capacity in class and who might be more helpful. 
# <a id='assignment'></a>Assignment
This week, we're doing Source Code reading. This will probably be a bit difficult at first but I just want you to try your best. As we move forward, it will get easier as you'll be exposed to more stuff. The point of assignments like these is to get you used to looking through source files for inspiration and fixes for things. 

The first assignment is simple, I want the labels that check for missile collision with walls and the playfield and I want you to tell me how they work and what the logic is. I want you to speculate a little as this is the first time so you probably won't exactly know but this source is VERY well commented and is the prototype of everything for the console.
# <a id = "getstart"></a>Getting Started and Admin
The Atari 2600 has a chip that processes game logic and a Television Interface Adapter that sends that logic to the television screen. It literally paints the screen in real time as the processor goes through the logic. This is why we tie everything to our frame as we count the various scanlines. 

There are a variety of things we need to keep track of here. First, let's think about this: 

	The background dictates the color of certain things. For example. Consider how colors in the 2600 work. We know that it can display a total of 128 colors and they can be displayed at the same time but below each other or in each individual scanline. 

This allows for our rainbow to appear though we were not going with all 128! Next, each scanline can only have 4 colors displayed at any given time. 

Finally, it is important to remember that some stuff shares colors. So, these share colors: 
* Playfield and Ball 
* Player0 and missile0 
* Player1 and missile1 

And to that end, we have 7 distinct game elements. Those elements are: 
1. Background 
2. Playfield 
3. Player 1 
4. Player 2 
5. Missile 1 
6. Missile 2 
7. Ball

So let's think about this image again: 

![](/images/resolution.png)
We messed with this a little because of last week where we literally set up our frame and started making 3 scanlines and made a gentle rainbow. This is all background and so we will be moving from background to playfield in this lesson. As a refresher: 

![Combat-Screen.png](/images/Combat-Screen.png)

For reference, here's a Hex value color chart: 
![colorhexmap.jpg](/images/colorhexmap.jpg)
Additionally, we're going 

We're going to mess around with a number of OpCodes today. Namely, we'll be mucking about with: 
* `COLUBK` or Color of the Background.
* `COLUPF` or Color of the Playfield.
* `CTRLPF` or Control Playfield, Ball
	* This is basically a flag but we set it by value. 
	* D0: Reflect the playfield.
	* D1: Score
	* D2: Priority
	* D4-D5: Ball Size (1,2,4,8)
* `PF0,PF1,PF2` - Playfield Registers all are essentially binaries. 1 mean active, 0 means inactive.
	* `PF0` = bytes 4,5,6,7
	* `PF1` = bytes 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0
	* `PF2`= bytes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

We won't get into a lot of these last ones with the ball today but it's good to introduce it here. A good list of what these are can be found: https://8bitworkshop.com/docs/platforms/vcs/
# <a id="background"></a>Background
The background dictates the color of certain things. For example. Consider how colors in the 2600 work. We know that it can display a total of 128 colors and they can be displayed at the same time but below each other or in each individual scanline. 

This allows for our rainbow to appear though we were not going with all 128! Next, each scanline can only have 4 colors displayed at any given time. 

Finally, it is important to remember that some stuff shares colors. So: 
* Playfield and Ball 
* Player0 and missile0 
* Player1 and missile1 

This leaves us with 7 distinct game elements. Those elements are: 
1. Background 
2. Playfield 
3. Player 1 
4. Player 2 
5. Missile 1 
6. Missile 2 
7. Ball

While this doesn't seem like a lot, we got to keep all of this in mind while we work on our games. For example, while the playfield and ball have the same color, we need to be mindful of player0 and player1's color difference, especially as it relates to both the background and playfield. Should these things match, you may have some issues! 

First, let's mess a bit with some background colors. Let's go ahead and set up our basic shell.

```asm6502
	processor 6502
	include "vcs.h"
    include "macro.h"
    include "xmacro.h"

# <a id ='classpf'></a>Playfield example from class 
This is the code I wanted to demo in class as it introduces a TON of concepts. 

```asm6502
; Assembler should use basic 6502 instructions
	processor 6502
	
; Include files for Atari 2600 constants and handy macro routines
	include "vcs.h"
	include "macro.h"

; 4K Atari 2600 ROMs usually start at address $F000
	org  $f000

; The CLEAN_START macro zeroes RAM and registers
Start	CLEAN_START 	; check out macro.h for this. 

	ldx #$80	; This is the hex code for a dark blue.
        stx COLUBK	; This will set the Color of the background, Blue.
        
        lda #$1C	; This is the hex value for a bright yellow.
        sta COLUPF	; This will store the hex value as the color of the playfield.

; ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
;	As usual, we need to take care of our start frames and blanks.
;```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

StartFrame:
	lda #02		; we need to send a bit that turns on something.
        sta VBLANK	; In this case, we're turning on VBLANK and VSYNC
        sta VSYNC	; MAIN SCREEN, TURN ON

;```````````````````````````````````
;	We gonna do something funky here with DASM codes instead of OPCODES
;```````````````````````````````````
	REPEAT 3	; Repeat 3 times
	sta WSYNC	; 3 Scanlines of WSYNC
        REPEND		; Repeat Ends 
        
        ; We then need to turn those things off so we can move into the next part above the drawable area.
        
        lda #0		; Load byte of 0
        sta VSYNC	; Store that byte as VSYNC, thus turning it off.

	REPEAT 37	; Repeat this 37 times.

        lda #0		; Load byte of 0
        sta VBLANK	; Store that byte as VSYNC, thus turning it off. 

; Note here that we've now sufficiently gotten ourselves down to the start of 192 lines of drawable space.
; We turn on VSYNC and VBLANK to do this and get ourselves set up to DO STUFF and DRAW. 
; So now we have to start dealing with other content like the background and playfield.

;````````````````````````````````````
;	Let's set up the playfield and deal with CTLPF
;````````````````````````````````````
	ldx #%00000001	; CTRLPF of D0 means reflect. Try setting this to 0 and see what happens. 
	stx CTRLPF 	; Load this bit

;	Now it's time to do stuff with our 192 lines. We have to deal with it mathematically. 
;````````````````````````````````````

; 192 total lines, 10 lines down, playfield begins, playfield is 8 lines tall. So, let's math it out. 10 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 156

        stx PF0		; this basically disables the PF0 Playfield Register.

        sta WSYNC	; Wait 156 lines.

        ldx #%11100000	; PF0 is just 4 bits and they're the high bits so 1110 for not computers is 0111 or "Skip a line then do it." However, DASM expects us to account for all 8 bytes.

	; and then the end of the playfield screen. 
        
        ldx #0		; We load a value that is blank

We're going to take a piece of a tutorial from a youtuber named 8blit and work on it a bit. You can find this on his github repository at: https://github.com/kreiach/8Blit

	processor 6502		; We need to call into being the 6502 on our IDE.
	include	 "vcs.h"
    include "macro.h"

; For this task, we're going to actually use some memory to mess around with the TIA PF0, PF1, PF2, and CTLRPF Registers. Along the way, we'll explore the issues of overscanning and safe areas to draw in the safe visual area of the screen with the the recommended number of VBLANK's
