; How to Draw A Playfield.
; by Nick Bensema  9:23PM  3/2/97
;
; Atari 2600 programming is different from any other kind of programming
; in many ways.  Just one of these ways is the flow of the program.
;
; Since the CPU must hold tha TIA's hand through all graphical operations,
; the flow ought to go like this:
;
; Clear memory and registers
; Set up variables
; Loop:
;    Do the vertical blank
;    Do game calculations
;    Draw screen
;    Do more calculations during overscan
;    Wait for next vertical blank
; End Loop.
;
; What I will do is create an outline, and explain everything I can.
; This program will display "HELLO" and scroll it down the screen.
;
; In writing this program, I will take the opportunity to show you
; how a few simple modifications can completely change a program's
; appearance or behavior.  I will invite you to comment out a few
; lines of code, and alter others, so that you can observe the results.
;
; I will be using DASM for now.  Conversion to A65 should be trivial.
;
        processor 6502
        include vcs.h

        org $F000

Temp       = $80
PlayfieldY = $90

Start
;
; The 2600 powers up in a completely random state, except for the PC which
; is set to the location at $FFC.  Therefore the first thing we must do is
; to set everything up inside the 6502.
;
        SEI  ; Disable interrupts, if there are any.
        CLD  ; Clear BCD math bit.
;
; You may feel the need to use the stack, in which case:
;
        LDX  #$FF
        TXS  ; Set stack to beginning.
;
; Now the memory and TIA registers must be cleared.  You may feel the
; need to write a subroutine that only clears out a certain section of
; memory, but for now a simple loop will suffice.
;
; Since X is already loaded to 0xFF, our task becomes simply to ocunt
; everything off.
;
        LDA #0
B1      STA 0,X
        DEX
        BNE B1
;
; The above routine does not clear location 0, which is VSYNC.  We will
; take care of that later.
;
; At this point in the code we would set up things like the data
; direction registers for the joysticks and such.
;
        JSR  GameInit
;
; Here is a representation of our program flow.
;
MainLoop
        JSR  VerticalBlank ;Execute the vertical blank.
        JSR  CheckSwitches ;Check console switches.
        JSR  GameCalc      ;Do calculations during Vblank
        JSR  DrawScreen    ;Draw the screen
        JSR  OverScan      ;Do more calculations during overscan
        JMP  MainLoop      ;Continue forever.
;
; It is important to maintain a stable screen, and this routine
; does some important and mysterious things.  Actually, the only
; mysterious part is VSYNC.  All VBLANK does is blank the TIA's
; output so that no graphics are drawn; otherwise the screen
; scans normally.  It is VSYNC which tells the TV to pack its
; bags and move to the other corner of the screen.
;
; Fortunately, my program sets VBLANK at the beginning of the
; overscan period, which usually precedes this subroutine, so
; it is not changed here.
;
VerticalBlank
        LDX  #0
        LDA  #2
        STA  WSYNC
        STA  WSYNC
        STA  WSYNC
        STA  VSYNC ;Begin vertical sync.
        STA  WSYNC ; First line of VSYNC
        STA  WSYNC ; Second line of VSYNC.
;
; But before we finish off the third line of VSYNC, why don't we
; use this time to set the timer?  This will save us a few cycles
; which would be more useful in the overscan area.
;
; To insure that we begin to draw the screen at the proper time,
; we must set the timer to go off just slightly before the end of
; the vertical blank space, so that we can WSYNC up to the ACTUAL
; end of the vertical blank space.  Of course, the scanline we're
; going to omit is the same scanline we were about to waste VSYNCing,
; so it all evens out.
;
; Atari says we have to have 37 scanlines of VBLANK time.  Since
; each scanline uses 76 cycles, that makes 37*76=2888 cycles.
; We must also subtract the five cycles it will take to set the
; timer, and the three cycles it will take to STA WSYNC to the next
; line.  Plus the checking loop is only accurate to six cycles, making
; a total of fourteen cycles we have to waste.  2888-14=2876.
;
; We almost always use TIM64T for this, since the math just won't
; work out with the other intervals.  2880/64=44.something.  It
; doesn't matter what that something is, we have to round DOWN.
;
        LDA  #44
        STA  TIM64T
;
; And now's as good a time as any to clear the collision latches.
;
        LDA #0
        STA CXCLR
;
; Now we can end the VSYNC period.
;
        STA  WSYNC ; Third line of VSYNC.
        STA  VSYNC ; (0)
;
; At this point in time the screen is scanning normally, but
; the TIA's output is suppressed.  It will begin again once
; 0 is written back into VBLANK.
;
        RTS
;
; Checking the game switches is relatively simple.  Theoretically,
; some of it could be slipped between WSYNCs in the VBlank code.
; But we're going for clarity here.
;
; It just so happens that I'm not going to check any game switches
; here.  I'm just going to set up the colors, without even checking
; the B&W switch!  HA!
;
CheckSwitches
       LDA #0
       STA COLUBK  ; Background will be black.
       RTS
;
; Minimal game calculations, just to get the ball rolling.
;
GameCalc
        INC PlayfieldY   ;Inch up the playfield
        RTS

;
; This is the scariest thing I've done all month.
;
DrawScreen
        LDA INTIM
        BNE DrawScreen ; Whew!
        STA WSYNC
        STA VBLANK  ;End the VBLANK period with a zero.
;
; Now we can do what we need to do.  What sort of playfield do
; we want to show?  A doubled playfield will work better than
; anything if we either want a side scroller (which involves some
; tricky bit shifting, usually) or an asymmetrical playfield (which
; we're not doing yet).  A mirrored playfield is usually best for
; vertical scrollers.  With some creativity, you can use both in your
; game.
;
; The "score" bit is useful for drawing scores with playfield graphics
; as Combat and other early games do.  It can also create a neat effect
; if you know how to be creative with it.  One useful application of
; score mode would be always having player 1 on the left side, and
; player 0 on the right side.  Each player would be surrounded in the
; opposite color, and the ball graphic could be used to stand out
; against either one.  On my 2600jr, color from the right side bleeds
; about one pixel into the left side, so don't think it's perfect.
; It's really far from perfect because PC Atari does not implement
; it at all; both sides appear as Player 0's color.  A26 does, though.
;
; To accomodate this, my routine puts color values into
; COLUP0 for the left side, and COLUP1 for the right side.  Change
; the LDA operand to 0 or 1 to use the normal system.  The code in
; the scanning loop accounts for both systems.
;
        LDA  #2
        STA  CTRLPF
;
; Initialize some display variables.
;
        ;There aren't any display variables!
;
; I'm going to use the Y register to count scanlines this time.
; Realize that I am forfeiting the use of the Y register for this
; purpose, but DEC Zero Page takes five cycles as opposed to DEY's
; two, and LDA Zero Page takes three cycles as opposed to TYA's two.
;
; I'm using all 191 remaining scanlines after the WSYNC.  If you
; want less, or more, change the LDY line.
;
; This is a decremental loop, that is, Y starts at 191 and continues
; down to 0, as do all functions of Y such as memory locations, which
; is why the graphics at the end of this file are stored "bottom-up".
; In a way, one could say that's how the screen is drawn.  To turn this
; into an incremental loop, change the number to 255-191 (65) and change
; the DEY at the end ot the scanning loop to INY.
;
        LDY #191
;
; Okay, now THIS is scary.  I decided to put the bulk of my comments
; BEFORE the code, rather than inside it, so that you can look at the
; code all at once.
;
; Notice the new method of cycle counting I use.  I'll send an update
; to cyccount.txt RSN.
;
; This routine came out surprisingly clean.  There are no branches,
; and most updates are made even before PF0 becomes visible at cycle 23,
; even though PF1 and PF2 don't become visible until, by my estimate,
; cycles 29 and 40, respectively.  We could use this time to get player
; shape and colors from temp variables and sneak them in, but that's
; another file.  In fact, at the last minute I re-arranged things
; and threw in some color changes.
;
; The playfield will only be moved up every 4 scanlines, so it doesn't look
; squished.  I could have updated it every 2 scanlines, and that would have
; saved two cycles. I could have saved another two cycles by having it
; change EVERY scanline.  Comment out one or both of the ASL's to see what
; this would look like.  I realize that it updates the PF registers whether
; it needs it or not, but it would be pointless to branch around these
; updates.  Better to know you're wasting cycles and have them counted
; than to get unlucky and have your code spill into the next scanline
; every time too many things get updated.
;
; This is going to be a moving playfield.  For a stationary playfield,
; comment out the SEC and SBC lines.  That's probably what most of you all
; are going to want, anyway.  And for a really good moving playfield,
; like in River Raid or Vanguard, you'll need slightly more interesting
; code than I'm prepared to provide.
;
; I also could have made the playfield graphic 16 bytes high, or 32, or 64,
; by changing only my data and the AND line.  AND can serve as a modulus
; for any power of two (2^n) up to 128, by ANDing a byte with that number
; minus one ( (2^n)-1 ).  8 bytes * every 4 scanlines == 32, which is
; a power of two, which is why this works.  Try commenting out the AND line
; and see how the program interprets it.  Remember that PlayfieldY goes
; up to 255.
;
; But you won't need to worry about that if you're drawing a stationary
; playfield where the graphics data is so large, it doesn't need to repeat.
; In that case, you don't need the AND line and you don't need to make sure
; your graphics are 2^n bytes tall.  Comment out the AND, SEC and SBC lines,
; and add a third LSR to the block of two.  It indexes a bit too far at the
; top of the screen, which explains the garbage.  You can fix that problem
; either by adding more data to the end of each array, or by decreasing
; the resolution by adding a fourth or fifth LSR.
;
; And who's to say you'll need all three playfield registers?  Perhaps
; you have a rather narrow playfield, or one that's always clear in the
; middle.  Either choice will save you five cycles per scanline.
;
; As you can see, it can be trimmed down quite a bit, and I still have
; a lot of cycles left over.  The maximum, if you recall, is 73 if you
; plan to use STA WSYNC, and I pity the fool who doesn't.

;
; This is the tricky part of drawing a playfield: actually
; drawing it.  Well, the display routine and all that binary
; math was a bit tricky, too, but still, listen up.
;
; Playfield data isn't stored the way most bitmaps are, even
; one-dimensional bitmaps.  We will use the left side of the
; screen only, knowing that the right side is either repeated
; or reflected from it.
;
; In PF0 and PF2, the most significant bit (bit 7) is on the RIGHT
; side.  In PF1, the most significant bit is on the LEFT side.  This
; means that relative to PF0 and PF2, PF1 has a reversed bit order.

; This is important to remember when doing calculations on bytes intended

We'll be going through this in class. My hope here is to show you how the above examples work and in doing so, prepare you for your time if you want asymmetry in your life. Note here that it is not easy. I'll come up with some interesting examples for you at some point in the semester: 
```asm6502
;========================================
; A Simple Asymmetrical Title Screen Playfield
;
; this is a simple kernal meant to be usable for a title screen.
; can be adapted to put playfield text at an arbitrary height on the screen
;
; it owes a great debt to Glenn Saunders Thu, 20 Sep 2001 Stella post
; " Asymmetrical Reflected Playfield" (who in turn took from Roger Williams,
; who in turn took from Nick Bensema--yeesh!)
;
; it's meant to be a tightish, welll-commented, flexible kernal,
; that displays a title (or other playfield graphic) once, 
; instead of repeating it - also it's a steady 60 FPS, 262 scanlines,
; unlike some of its predecessors
;
; also, it's non-reflected, so you can easily use a tool like my
; online javascript tool at http://alienbill.com/vgames/playerpal/
; to draw the playfield
;
; It uses no RAM, but all Registers when it's drawing the title 
;========================================

	processor 6502
	include vcs.h
	include macro.h
	org $F000

	CLEAN_START

	lda #00
	sta COLUBK  ;black background 	
	lda #33    
	sta COLUPF  ;colored playfield

;MainLoop starts with usual VBLANK code,
;and the usual timer seeding
;========================================

MainLoop
	VERTICAL_SYNC
	lda #43	
	sta TIM64T
	
;========================================
; lots of logic can go here, obviously,
; and then we'll get to the point where we're waiting
; for the timer to run out
;========================================

WaitForVblankEnd
	lda INTIM	; So, we've written to the 64-timer. What this does is basically wait for the timer to end. We can really only use this when we're dealing with TIM64T
	bne WaitForVblankEnd	
	sta VBLANK  	

;========================================
;so, scanlines. We have three loops; 
;TitlePreLoop , TitleShowLoop, TitlePostLoop
;
; I found that if the 3 add up to 174 WSYNCS,
; you should get the desired 262 lines per frame
;
; The trick is, the middle loop is

# Another Example
This one comes from a legendary moment in the history of tutorials. Nick Bensema in 1997 wrote this: https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~rbaeza/cursos/proyarq/avera/play.html. 

This example has a MASSIVE amount of new concepts, opcodes, and things.

; How to Draw A Playfield.
; by Nick Bensema  9:23PM  3/2/97
;
; Atari 2600 programming is different from any other kind of programming
; in many ways.  Just one of these ways is the flow of the program.
;
; Since the CPU must hold tha TIA's hand through all graphical operations,
; the flow ought to go like this:
;
; Clear memory and registers
; Set up variables

; Loop:
;    Do the vertical blank
;    Do game calculations
;    Draw screen
;    Do more calculations during overscan
;    Wait for next vertical blank

; End Loop.
;
; What I will do is create an outline, and explain everything I can.
; This program will display "HELLO" and scroll it down the screen.
;
; In writing this program, I will take the opportunity to show you
; how a few simple modifications can completely change a program's
; appearance or behavior.  I will invite you to comment out a few
; lines of code, and alter others, so that you can observe the results.
;
; I will be using DASM for now.  Conversion to A65 should be trivial.
;
        processor 6502
        include vcs.h

        org $F000

Temp       = $80
PlayfieldY = $90

Start
;
; The 2600 powers up in a completely random state, except for the PC which
; is set to the location at $FFC.  Therefore the first thing we must do is
; to set everything up inside the 6502.
;
        SEI  ; Disable interrupts, if there are any.
        CLD  ; Clear BCD math bit.
;
; You may feel the need to use the stack, in which case:
;
        LDX  #$FF
        TXS  ; Set stack to beginning.
;
; Now the memory and TIA registers must be cleared.  You may feel the
; need to write a subroutine that only clears out a certain section of
; memory, but for now a simple loop will suffice.
;
; Since X is already loaded to 0xFF, our task becomes simply to ocunt
; everything off.
;
        LDA #0
B1      STA 0,X
        DEX
        BNE B1
;
; The above routine does not clear location 0, which is VSYNC.  We will
; take care of that later.
;
; At this point in the code we would set up things like the data
; direction registers for the joysticks and such.
;
        JSR  GameInit
;
; Here is a representation of our program flow.
;
MainLoop
        JSR  VerticalBlank ;Execute the vertical blank.
        JSR  CheckSwitches ;Check console switches.
        JSR  GameCalc      ;Do calculations during Vblank
        JSR  DrawScreen    ;Draw the screen
        JSR  OverScan      ;Do more calculations during overscan
        JMP  MainLoop      ;Continue forever.
;
; It is important to maintain a stable screen, and this routine
; does some important and mysterious things.  Actually, the only
; mysterious part is VSYNC.  All VBLANK does is blank the TIA's
; output so that no graphics are drawn; otherwise the screen
; scans normally.  It is VSYNC which tells the TV to pack its
; bags and move to the other corner of the screen.
;
; Fortunately, my program sets VBLANK at the beginning of the
; overscan period, which usually precedes this subroutine, so
; it is not changed here.
;
VerticalBlank
        LDX  #0
        LDA  #2
        STA  WSYNC
        STA  WSYNC
        STA  WSYNC
        STA  VSYNC ;Begin vertical sync.
        STA  WSYNC ; First line of VSYNC
        STA  WSYNC ; Second line of VSYNC.
;
; But before we finish off the third line of VSYNC, why don't we
; use this time to set the timer?  This will save us a few cycles
; which would be more useful in the overscan area.
;
; To insure that we begin to draw the screen at the proper time,
; we must set the timer to go off just slightly before the end of
; the vertical blank space, so that we can WSYNC up to the ACTUAL
; end of the vertical blank space.  Of course, the scanline we're
; going to omit is the same scanline we were about to waste VSYNCing,
; so it all evens out.
;
; Atari says we have to have 37 scanlines of VBLANK time.  Since
; each scanline uses 76 cycles, that makes 37*76=2888 cycles.
; We must also subtract the five cycles it will take to set the
; timer, and the three cycles it will take to STA WSYNC to the next
; line.  Plus the checking loop is only accurate to six cycles, making
; a total of fourteen cycles we have to waste.  2888-14=2876.
;
; We almost always use TIM64T for this, since the math just won't
; work out with the other intervals.  2880/64=44.something.  It
; doesn't matter what that something is, we have to round DOWN.
;
        LDA  #44
        STA  TIM64T
;
; And now's as good a time as any to clear the collision latches.
;
        LDA #0
        STA CXCLR
;
; Now we can end the VSYNC period.
;
        STA  WSYNC ; Third line of VSYNC.
        STA  VSYNC ; (0)
;
; At this point in time the screen is scanning normally, but
; the TIA's output is suppressed.  It will begin again once
; 0 is written back into VBLANK.
;
        RTS
;
; Checking the game switches is relatively simple.  Theoretically,
; some of it could be slipped between WSYNCs in the VBlank code.
; But we're going for clarity here.
;
; It just so happens that I'm not going to check any game switches
; here.  I'm just going to set up the colors, without even checking
; the B&W switch!  HA!
;
CheckSwitches
       LDA #0
       STA COLUBK  ; Background will be black.
       RTS
;
; Minimal game calculations, just to get the ball rolling.
;
GameCalc
        INC PlayfieldY   ;Inch up the playfield
        RTS

;
; This is the scariest thing I've done all month.
;
DrawScreen
        LDA INTIM
        BNE DrawScreen ; Whew!
        STA WSYNC
        STA VBLANK  ;End the VBLANK period with a zero.
;
; Now we can do what we need to do.  What sort of playfield do
; we want to show?  A doubled playfield will work better than
; anything if we either want a side scroller (which involves some
; tricky bit shifting, usually) or an asymmetrical playfield (which
; we're not doing yet).  A mirrored playfield is usually best for
; vertical scrollers.  With some creativity, you can use both in your
; game.
;
; The "score" bit is useful for drawing scores with playfield graphics
; as Combat and other early games do.  It can also create a neat effect
; if you know how to be creative with it.  One useful application of
; score mode would be always having player 1 on the left side, and
; player 0 on the right side.  Each player would be surrounded in the
; opposite color, and the ball graphic could be used to stand out
; against either one.  On my 2600jr, color from the right side bleeds
; about one pixel into the left side, so don't think it's perfect.
; It's really far from perfect because PC Atari does not implement
; it at all; both sides appear as Player 0's color.  A26 does, though.
;
; To accomodate this, my routine puts color values into
; COLUP0 for the left side, and COLUP1 for the right side.  Change
; the LDA operand to 0 or 1 to use the normal system.  The code in
; the scanning loop accounts for both systems.
;
        LDA  #2
        STA  CTRLPF
;
; Initialize some display variables.
;
        ;There aren't any display variables!
;
; I'm going to use the Y register to count scanlines this time.
; Realize that I am forfeiting the use of the Y register for this
; purpose, but DEC Zero Page takes five cycles as opposed to DEY's
; two, and LDA Zero Page takes three cycles as opposed to TYA's two.
;
; I'm using all 191 remaining scanlines after the WSYNC.  If you
; want less, or more, change the LDY line.
;
; This is a decremental loop, that is, Y starts at 191 and continues
; down to 0, as do all functions of Y such as memory locations, which
; is why the graphics at the end of this file are stored "bottom-up".
; In a way, one could say that's how the screen is drawn.  To turn this
; into an incremental loop, change the number to 255-191 (65) and change
; the DEY at the end ot the scanning loop to INY.
;
        LDY #191
;
; Okay, now THIS is scary.  I decided to put the bulk of my comments
; BEFORE the code, rather than inside it, so that you can look at the
; code all at once.
;
; Notice the new method of cycle counting I use.  I'll send an update
; to cyccount.txt RSN.
;
; This routine came out surprisingly clean.  There are no branches,
; and most updates are made even before PF0 becomes visible at cycle 23,
; even though PF1 and PF2 don't become visible until, by my estimate,
; cycles 29 and 40, respectively.  We could use this time to get player
; shape and colors from temp variables and sneak them in, but that's
; another file.  In fact, at the last minute I re-arranged things
; and threw in some color changes.
;
; The playfield will only be moved up every 4 scanlines, so it doesn't look
; squished.  I could have updated it every 2 scanlines, and that would have
; saved two cycles. I could have saved another two cycles by having it
; change EVERY scanline.  Comment out one or both of the ASL's to see what
; this would look like.  I realize that it updates the PF registers whether
; it needs it or not, but it would be pointless to branch around these
; updates.  Better to know you're wasting cycles and have them counted
; than to get unlucky and have your code spill into the next scanline
; every time too many things get updated.
;
; This is going to be a moving playfield.  For a stationary playfield,
; comment out the SEC and SBC lines.  That's probably what most of you all
; are going to want, anyway.  And for a really good moving playfield,
; like in River Raid or Vanguard, you'll need slightly more interesting
; code than I'm prepared to provide.
;
; I also could have made the playfield graphic 16 bytes high, or 32, or 64,
; by changing only my data and the AND line.  AND can serve as a modulus
; for any power of two (2^n) up to 128, by ANDing a byte with that number
; minus one ( (2^n)-1 ).  8 bytes * every 4 scanlines == 32, which is
; a power of two, which is why this works.  Try commenting out the AND line
; and see how the program interprets it.  Remember that PlayfieldY goes
; up to 255.
;
; But you won't need to worry about that if you're drawing a stationary
; playfield where the graphics data is so large, it doesn't need to repeat.
; In that case, you don't need the AND line and you don't need to make sure
; your graphics are 2^n bytes tall.  Comment out the AND, SEC and SBC lines,
; and add a third LSR to the block of two.  It indexes a bit too far at the
; top of the screen, which explains the garbage.  You can fix that problem
; either by adding more data to the end of each array, or by decreasing
; the resolution by adding a fourth or fifth LSR.
;
; And who's to say you'll need all three playfield registers?  Perhaps
; you have a rather narrow playfield, or one that's always clear in the
; middle.  Either choice will save you five cycles per scanline.
;
; As you can see, it can be trimmed down quite a bit, and I still have
; a lot of cycles left over.  The maximum, if you recall, is 73 if you
; plan to use STA WSYNC, and I pity the fool who doesn't.

; This is the tricky part of drawing a playfield: actually
; drawing it.  Well, the display routine and all that binary
; math was a bit tricky, too, but still, listen up.
;
; Playfield data isn't stored the way most bitmaps are, even
; one-dimensional bitmaps.  We will use the left side of the
; screen only, knowing that the right side is either repeated
; or reflected from it.
;
; In PF0 and PF2, the most significant bit (bit 7) is on the RIGHT
; side.  In PF1, the most significant bit is on the LEFT side.  This
; means that relative to PF0 and PF2, PF1 has a reversed bit order.
